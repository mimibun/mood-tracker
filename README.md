# Mimi's mood tracker

Currently this is a practice project to have me code more and also have a project that goes on for longer than just a few days. 

Regular mood trackers are either restrictive or do not go deep enough in my opinion and thus do not provide conclusive data. This mood tracker is supposed to change this based on design requirements provided by me. One of which being making use of he 87 emotions/experience provided by Brene Brown in her book "Atlas of the Heart". This book is close to my heart which is why evaluating emotions with her work in mind comes natural for me. 

## Planned features:

- Autocompletion of emotion selection
- WebGUI
- Ability to self-host
- Creation of nodes on an emotion to emotion basis to potentially receive interesting data
- Graphing

## Technical WIP:

- Refactor code to several files and seperate functionality (i.e. CLI to CLI, GUI to GUI, DB stuff to DB etc.)
- Potentially find solution for emotion selection autocomplete without a 3rd party library
